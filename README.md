I'm Mehr Bagga, and I'm on an exciting journey towards earning my B.Eng. in Computer Engineering CO-OP from McMaster University in 2027.

I'm not your typical computer engineer; I'm a lifelong learner with a strong curiosity! I'm passionate about mentorship and always eager to expand my knowledge. Feel free to connect with me at baggag@mcmaster.ca, and let's dive into the world of technology together!

Here's a glimpse of what makes me unique:

💡 As a skilled computer engineer, I don't just write code; I'm a creative problem-solver who thrives on crafting innovative software solutions that touch every corner of our digital realm – from building full-stack marvels to diving into the world of IoT and AI.

🚀 My coding toolbox includes Python, Java, C#, C++, HTML, Dart, and more. I'm your go-to tech wizard, well-versed in TensorFlow, React, React Native, Firebase, Flutter, and a bunch of other magic spells.

💻 Over the past three years, I've dedicated myself to perfecting the art of software application development. I'm on a mission to maximize productivity and efficiency, making me your go-to software efficiency enthusiast!

🌟 What's my secret weapon? I'm also a tech-savvy entrepreneur. I've co-founded not one, but two successful startups, blending problem-solving superpowers, sharp critical thinking, and a dash of creativity.

🌍 Beyond the tech realm, I'm a sports enthusiast, a music lover, an avid traveller, and a community advocate. I believe in giving back, and my diverse interests shape my dynamic personality.

🌐 Plus, I'm multilingual– fluent in English, Punjabi, American Sign Language, Hindi, and Urdu. I'm a bridge between cultures and a valuable asset to global teams.

Let's connect, chat tech, share experiences, and explore opportunities. Together, we can navigate the digital landscape effectively! 😄
